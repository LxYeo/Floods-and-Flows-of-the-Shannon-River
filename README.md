# Floods & Flows of the Shannon River

## 1) Title
Floods & Flows of the Shannon River

## 2) Background
The Shannon Basin faces both acute high-water events and long-term structural flood risk. In early October 2025, during Storm Amy, Waterways Ireland issued Marine Notice No. 115 of 2025 warning of rising water levels and hazardous navigation conditions on the Shannon Navigation; subsequent updates and reporting noted lock overtopping and temporary closures on connected waterways due to high water. These advisories show how quickly levels can rise and disrupt transport, tourism, and local activity along the river.

At the same time, the Shannon Town & Environs Flood Relief Scheme highlights the basin’s chronic exposure to flooding near the estuary. Historic embankments built in the 1940s–1950s helped enable development around Shannon Town and Airport, but today the area is at risk from both coastal and fluvial sources: wave-driven overtopping during high tides/bad storms, and drainage systems with limited outflow capacity where outfalls are tidally affected. The OPW’s CFRAM study identified Shannon Town and the Airport as priority areas and a dedicated flood relief scheme has been progressing since 2020 to develop economically viable and environmentally sustainable options.

Together, these factors show why the Shannon’s floods matter: people, infrastructure, navigation, and ecosystems are regularly impacted by short-notice surges and by legacy drainage constraints. A desk-based challenge using AI, data analytics, software, and multimedia can add real value—by improving prediction and communication, exploring nature-based adaptation virtually, and creating **interactive tools** that help communities, planners, and waterway users make better decisions.


## 3) Problem Statement
How might we use AI, software, data analytics, or multimedia to understand, predict, and communicate flooding dynamics in the Shannon Basin—improving the lives of communities along the river? Propose an interesting solution that leverages open Irish datasets to generate actionable insight, early-warning, compelling public engagement, and how the approach can be transferred to other basins.


## 4) Expected Outcomes
- **AI / data models:** rainfall–water-level correlations, nowcasting, or early-warning prototypes.  
- **Interactive tools:** web dashboards, or simulation sandboxes.  
- **Multimedia storytelling:** short animations, interactive narratives, or explainers.  
- **Design concepts:** visual communications for community preparedness or nature-based solutions.

## 5) Scope
Data analysis and machine-learning modeling, visualization, mapping, and storytelling (e.g., notebooks, dashboards/web apps, short animations).  
Avoid physical engineering designs, fieldwork, and proprietary/confidential data as those are out of scope.

**Target audience:**
- **Local authorities & Waterways Ireland** — decision support (short-term forecasts, risk maps).  
- **Communities & small businesses along the Shannon** — clear alerts/explainers and preparedness visuals.  
- **Emergency services** — 24–72h situational-awareness maps and pinch-point views.
- **Researchers/NGOs/educators** - reproducible methods, open data/code.
