# Floods & Flows of the Shannon River

## 1) Title
Floods & Flows of the Shannon River

## 2) Background (Why it matters)
The Shannon Basin frequently faces winter floods that disrupt homes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Climate change amplifies rainfall intensity, stressing communities and the river’s natural rhythms. Digital tools can help us **understand, predict, and communicate** how to live with water.

## 3) Problem Statement
**How might we use AI, software, data analytics, or multimedia** to understand, predict, or reimagine flooding in the Shannon Basin—improving the lives of communities living along the river?

## 4) Expected Outcomes 
- **AI / data models:** rainfall–level correlations, nowcasting, or early-warning prototypes.
- **Interactive tools:** web dashboards, flood maps, or simulation sandboxes.
- **Multimedia storytelling:** short animations, interactive narratives, or explainers.
- **Design concepts:** visual comms for community preparedness or nature-based solutions.

## 5) Scope
**Included:** data analysis and machine learning modelling, visualization and storytellng.  
**Excluded:** physical engineering designs, fieldwork, proprietary/confidential data.

## 6) Resources (data, tools)
- **Data portals:** see `/resources/data-portals.md` (OPW/CFRAM, Met Éireann, EPA/LAWPRO).
- **Tools:** `/resources/tools-and-stacks.md` (Python/R, QGIS/ArcGIS Online, Earth Engine, Blender/After Effects).
- **Examples:** `/examples/` starter notebooks & storyboards.

## 7) Inspiration (optional)
- Netherlands **Room for the River** (designing with floods)
- Community flood dashboards & open early-warning tools

## 8) Difficulty
**Intermediate–Advanced**.
